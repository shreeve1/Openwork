# OpenCode Web Server

Use this skill to manage a background `opencode web` server for the current workspace and make OpenWork-created sessions visible in the OpenCode web UI when possible.

## Purpose

- Run first-time setup checks for the current machine.
- Find the OpenCode data path with `opencode debug paths`.
- Verify `opencode.db` exists and is healthy.
- Diagnose session health and project/workspace mapping health before manual SQL inspection.
- Repair only safe, backed-up OpenWork/OpenCode compatibility issues.
- Start OpenCode web UI in the background for the active workspace.
- Bind to `0.0.0.0` so LAN devices can connect.
- Ask whether to prevent system sleep while the server runs, using a scoped helper when enabled.
- Save local runtime state outside shared repo content.
- Report LAN URL and log paths.
- Stop the server safely using saved PID.
- Check status without changing server state and clearly classify server, session, project mapping, and browser-current-project problems.

## Preferred helpers

Use helper scripts from this skill instead of long inline commands.

macOS/Linux:

- `.opencode/skills/opencode-web-server/scripts/opencode-web-server.sh bootstrap`
- `.opencode/skills/opencode-web-server/scripts/opencode-web-server.sh doctor --port 4096`
- `.opencode/skills/opencode-web-server/scripts/opencode-web-server.sh start --port 4096 --lan`
- `.opencode/skills/opencode-web-server/scripts/opencode-web-server.sh status --port 4096`
- `.opencode/skills/opencode-web-server/scripts/opencode-web-server.sh repair-project-mapping --apply`
- `.opencode/skills/opencode-web-server/scripts/opencode-web-server.sh stop`

The macOS/Linux helper prompts for sleep prevention only when stdin is interactive. macOS uses `caffeinate` when approved; Linux currently continues without sleep prevention.

Windows PowerShell:

- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .opencode\skills\opencode-web-server\scripts\opencode-web-server.ps1 bootstrap`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .opencode\skills\opencode-web-server\scripts\opencode-web-server.ps1 doctor -Port 4096`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .opencode\skills\opencode-web-server\scripts\opencode-web-server.ps1 start -Port 4096 -Lan`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .opencode\skills\opencode-web-server\scripts\opencode-web-server.ps1 status -Port 4096`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .opencode\skills\opencode-web-server\scripts\opencode-web-server.ps1 repair-project-mapping -Apply`
- `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .opencode\skills\opencode-web-server\scripts\opencode-web-server.ps1 stop`

Windows PowerShell options:

- Add `-PreventSleep` to skip the prompt and enable scoped sleep prevention.
- Add `-NoPreventSleep` to skip the prompt and leave sleep behavior unchanged.
- Add `-Apply` only with `repair-project-mapping` after reviewing doctor output.

## Commands

- `bootstrap`: run first-time checks, repair safe empty invalid session rows, and verify session/project health if a server is running.
- `doctor`: read-only fast diagnostic for listener ownership, root HTTP health, session API, project/current API, session rows, project rows, directory rows, and sandbox mapping clues.
- `repair-sessions`: run only empty invalid session compatibility repair.
- `repair-project-mapping`: read-only project mapping preflight for obvious wrong workspace sandbox/root attachment. `--apply` / `-Apply` is refused until a schema-specific safe repair is implemented.
- `start`: run bootstrap, adopt an expected already-running OpenCode web listener when safe, otherwise start server and verify server/session/project health.
- `stop`: stop only the saved server PID after verifying it belongs to `opencode`.
- `status`: quick report for PID, port, LAN URL, DB path, invalid row count, and listener state. Use `doctor` for deeper API and project mapping checks.

## Safety rules

- Local-network exposure is intentional but sensitive. Warn that anyone on the same trusted network who can reach the port may reach the OpenCode web server, depending on OpenCode auth/session behavior.
- Do not suggest internet exposure, port forwarding, tunnels, reverse proxies, or firewall opening unless the user explicitly asks and accepts risk.
- Bind to `0.0.0.0` only for LAN use. Use `127.0.0.1` for local-only use.
- Never patch sessions with messages.
- Never delete sessions.
- Always back up `opencode.db` before any database mutation.
- Stop before mutation if `sqlite3` is missing.
- Stop if database integrity check fails.
- Treat `doctor` and `status` as read-only commands.
- Project mapping repair must be schema-specific before it mutates data. Do not delete rows from unknown tables based on path-name heuristics alone.
- When multiple OpenCode data/database locations are discovered, list them and mutate only the active `opencode debug paths` database.
- Do not repair browser localStorage/current-project state by mutating browser data. Report it and tell the user to switch/refresh the project in the web UI.
- Before stopping, verify saved PID still belongs to an `opencode` process.
- Never kill broad process matches such as all `opencode` processes unless the user explicitly approves after seeing candidates.
- Store runtime state under `.opencode/runtime/opencode-web-server/`; do not commit runtime files.
- Use current workspace path, not hardcoded local paths.
- Do not permanently change OS power plans. Keep sleep prevention scoped to a helper process saved under runtime state.
- On stop, terminate only the saved keep-awake helper if it still looks script-owned. Never kill broad `caffeinate`, `powershell`, or `pwsh` matches.

## Runtime paths

Use workspace-relative runtime path:

- Directory: `.opencode/runtime/opencode-web-server/`
- PID file: `.opencode/runtime/opencode-web-server/server.pid`
- Log files: `.opencode/runtime/opencode-web-server/server.log` and `.opencode/runtime/opencode-web-server/server-err.log`
- URL file: `.opencode/runtime/opencode-web-server/server.url`
- Keep-awake PID file: `.opencode/runtime/opencode-web-server/keep-awake.pid`
- Windows keep-awake helper script: `.opencode/runtime/opencode-web-server/keep-awake.ps1`

If `.opencode/runtime/` is not ignored, add it to `.opencode/.gitignore` before starting the server.

## First-time setup workflow

1. Detect operating system.
2. Confirm `opencode` exists.
3. Confirm `sqlite3` exists before database repair.
4. Run `opencode debug paths` and parse the `data` path.
5. Confirm `<data>/opencode.db` exists.
6. Run `pragma integrity_check;` on the database.
7. Count bad session rows in the current workspace.
8. If bad rows exist, back up database using SQLite `.backup`.
9. Repair only rows that match all conditions:
   - `directory` equals current workspace path.
   - row has zero messages.
   - `agent` is null/empty, or `model` is null/empty, or `model` is invalid JSON.
10. Derive repair values from newest valid session in the same workspace.
11. If no valid session exists, use fallback values:
   - `agent='openwork'`
   - `model='{"id":"gpt-5.5","providerID":"cliproxy","variant":"default"}'`
12. Verify integrity again.
13. Verify invalid empty row count is zero.

## Start workflow

1. Run bootstrap first.
2. Check saved PID; if running and process is `opencode`, report existing server.
3. Check target port. If occupied, identify listener PID/command.
4. If listener command is verified as an OpenCode listener for the requested port and root HTTP check passes, adopt it instead of failing, even if session API fails. Accept both command shapes:
   - `opencode web --hostname ... --port ...`
   - `opencode --hostname ... --mdns --port ...`
   - write runtime PID and URL.
   - create optional scoped sleep-prevention helper if requested.
   - run doctor and report any session/project/browser mismatch or session API failure.
5. If listener is unrelated or cannot be verified, report `unrelated process on port` and stop unless user approves next action.
6. Get LAN IP.
7. Ask whether to prevent system sleep while the server runs.
8. If approved, start scoped sleep-prevention helper:
   - Windows: hidden PowerShell helper using `SetThreadExecutionState`; save helper PID. `-PreventSleep` enables this without prompting. `-NoPreventSleep` skips the prompt.
   - macOS: `caffeinate`; save helper PID.
   - Other OS: report unsupported and continue without sleep prevention.
9. Start `opencode web` in background.
10. Save PID, URL, and log paths.
11. Verify process is alive and port is listening.
12. Verify web root returns HTTP success.
13. Verify session API without Basic auth; start clears inherited `OPENCODE_SERVER_USERNAME` and `OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD` only for the child process.
14. Run doctor to classify session rows, project mapping rows, `project/current` API state, and likely browser-current-project mismatch.
15. Report local URL, LAN URL, PID file, log files, sleep-prevention state, and backup path if repair occurred.

## Doctor workflow

1. Resolve active OpenCode data path and database from `opencode debug paths`.
2. Also list likely alternate `opencode.db` locations from common OpenCode/OpenWork data directories when visible.
3. Check target port and classify:
   - `server not running`
   - `expected OpenCode server already running`
   - `unrelated process on port`
4. If server responds, check root HTTP, session API for current workspace, and best-effort `project/current` API. Treat missing or changed `project/current` route as diagnostic signal, not proof by itself.
   - If session API succeeds and database mapping looks OK, but `project/current.worktree` differs from the requested workspace, report `browser current-project issue likely`.
5. Compare current workspace root against database tables when present:
   - `session.directory` rows.
   - `project` rows with root/path/worktree columns.
   - project directory rows in tables with both project and directory/path/root-like columns.
   - sandbox/root mappings in tables with sandbox and project/root/path-like columns.
6. Print one-line diagnosis first, such as `server OK, sessions OK, project mapping broken, safe repair available`.
7. Keep raw SQL output short and public-safe; do not print message contents, prompts, secrets, or logs.

## Project mapping repair workflow

1. Run doctor first.
2. Confirm database integrity is `ok`.
3. Refuse repair unless evidence shows current workspace has session rows but project/directory mapping points under another workspace or sandbox/root relationship.
4. Stop before mutation unless the helper recognizes a specific, documented OpenCode schema/table pattern.
5. Current helper reports candidates only and refuses `--apply` / `-Apply` with `project mapping broken, manual review required`.
6. Future schema-specific repair must back up the database, run a narrow transaction, verify integrity again, run doctor again, and report remaining state.

## Stop workflow

1. Read PID file.
2. If missing, report no saved server state and offer status scan if useful.
3. Verify process exists and command/args include `opencode`.
4. Send graceful stop.
5. Wait briefly.
6. If still running, ask before force kill. Do not force-kill without confirmation.
7. Remove PID and URL files only after process stops or PID was stale.
8. Stop saved keep-awake helper only if it still looks script-owned.
9. Keep log files for troubleshooting unless user asks to remove them.

## Status workflow

1. Verify saved PID if present.
2. Check port listener.
3. Read URL file if present.
4. Check OpenCode data path and database presence.
5. Count invalid empty session rows for current workspace.
6. Check only quick listener state. Do not run deep API or mapping scans from `status`.
7. Report one of:
   - Running: include PID, URL, log paths, sleep-prevention state, and listener state.
   - Stale PID: include stale PID and recommend cleanup.
   - Not running: include whether port is free or occupied by another process.

## OpenWork session compatibility notes

OpenWork sessions can already live in OpenCode's `opencode.db`. OpenCode web may fail to list sessions if old empty rows have missing `agent` or `model` values. This skill repairs only empty invalid rows, after backup, so real chat history is not modified.

If browser project switching fails while session API succeeds, suspect project mapping or browser `localStorage` current-project state. Run `doctor` before manual SQL inspection.

If session API still fails after repair, stop and report:

- DB integrity result.
- invalid empty row count.
- project mapping diagnosis.
- API HTTP status and body reference.
- server log paths.

## Success criteria

- Bootstrap: database path found, integrity `ok`, invalid empty rows fixed or none found, and project mapping checked.
- Doctor: one-line diagnosis clearly distinguishes server-not-running, expected OpenCode server, unrelated port listener, session-row issue, project-mapping issue, and browser-current-project issue.
- Start: `opencode web` process is alive or safely adopted, port is listening, URL file exists, LAN URL reported, and any requested sleep-prevention helper is running with a saved PID.
- Session list: OpenCode web UI/API lists OpenWork-created sessions for the current workspace.
- Stop: saved PID no longer running, PID and URL files removed or marked stale, any script-owned sleep-prevention helper stopped, log files preserved.
- Status: process, port, database, and quick listener state reported without modifying running server.
