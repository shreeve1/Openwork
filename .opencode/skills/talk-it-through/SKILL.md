name: talk-it-through
description: Talk-it-through session that stress-tests a plan or process against the team's shared language and previously recorded decisions, sharpens fuzzy terminology, maintains a CONTEXT.md glossary inline, and automatically records what was settled — decisions, preferences, workflows, docs, and glossary entities — to personal memory when the session wraps up. Use when the user wants to pressure-test a plan, workflow, or document, sense-check a decision, or mentions "talk it through".

<what-to-do>

Interview me to reach a shared understanding of this plan, process, or document — but apply the 80/20 rule. Spend your questions on the vital few decisions that determine most of the outcome: the ones that are hard to reverse, that other decisions hang off of, or where getting it wrong is expensive or embarrassing. Skip the trivial many.

Before each question, ask yourself: "Does this decision meaningfully change the plan, or am I just walking a branch for completeness?" If the branch is low-stakes, easily reversible, or has an obvious default, state your recommended default in one line and move on — do not turn it into a question. Prune branches that don't change what we do.

Resolve dependencies in order — settle a foundational decision before the ones that depend on it — but only descend into a sub-branch when the answer would actually shift the plan. For each real question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time, waiting for feedback on each question before continuing.

Always output questions as plain text in the chat. Never use the `ask_user_question` / `AskUserQuestion` tool — this is a back-and-forth conversation, not a multiple-choice form.

Stop when the remaining open questions are all low-stakes detail. At that point, say so and summarize the defaults you're assuming for the rest rather than continuing to probe.

If a question can be answered by checking existing material (the memory folder, prior decisions, a referenced document, or the workspace), check it instead of asking. If it can be answered by a web search (a vendor's published policy, a product's documented behavior, current guidance), search the web instead.

## Awareness of existing language and decisions

At the start of a session, look for what's already been decided so you can challenge against it:

- A `CONTEXT.md` at the workspace root — canonical vocabulary: contested/overloaded terms with a chosen form and aliases to avoid ("which meaning?"). See [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).
- `memory/glossary.md` — the entity directory: shorthand -> full identity ("who/what is this?"). CONTEXT.md and glossary.md are siblings — keep contested vocabulary in CONTEXT.md and plain label expansions in glossary.md.
- `memory/index.md` — read the whole Promoted Memory table. This is the discoverability map for everything in memory, not just decisions: preferences, workflows, docs, and decisions all appear here.

Read the index up front, but pull full memory files lazily: open a specific entry (for example a row under `memory/preferences/`, `memory/workflows/`, `memory/docs/`, or `memory/decisions/`) only when its summary looks like it might inform or contradict the topic being discussed. Don't eagerly read the whole memory tree every session. See [DECISIONS-FORMAT.md](./DECISIONS-FORMAT.md) for decision specifics.

Create files lazily — only when you have something to write. If no `CONTEXT.md` exists, create one when the first term is resolved. Use only the known sections from [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md); do not invent unresolved terms, relationships, or example dialogue just to fill the file.

## During the session

### Challenge against the glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with the agreed language in `CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately. "Your glossary defines 'client' as a billing entity, but you seem to mean the day-to-day contact — which is it?"

### Sharpen fuzzy language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term. "You're saying 'sign-off' — do you mean the manager's approval or the client's acceptance? Those are different gates."

### Discuss concrete scenarios

When relationships between people, steps, or documents are being discussed, stress-test them with specific scenarios. Invent realistic situations that probe edge cases and force the user to be precise about who does what, in what order, and what happens when something is missing.

### Cross-reference with what's recorded

When the user states how something works, check whether the recorded memory or the referenced document agrees. If you find a contradiction, surface it: "Last month you decided invoices go out on the 1st, but you just said month-end — which is right?"

### Maintain CONTEXT.md inline

When a term is resolved, update `CONTEXT.md` right there. Don't batch these up — capture them as they happen. Use the format in [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](./CONTEXT-FORMAT.md).

`CONTEXT.md` is a glossary of agreed terms and relationships — nothing else. Keep it free of step-by-step procedure, task lists, or decision rationale. Those belong in the document being discussed or in a memory decision. Plain shorthand -> identity expansions belong in `memory/glossary.md`, not here.

Leave sections absent until they have real content. For example, do not add `Example dialogue` until there is a useful real or synthesized exchange that clarifies the terms.

## Wrapping up — record what was settled automatically

These users are office and admin staff, so this step is automated. Do **not** ask "do you want to record this?" A session wraps up when the user says to stop/wrap up, when you determine the remaining questions are low-stakes detail, or before you give the final summary.

A talk-it-through session is itself the approval: the user was actively in the loop settling things. So anything **clearly settled in-session** is promoted directly to its proper topic file. For anything you merely **inferred but did not explicitly confirm** with the user, do not write it — ask in one line whether to record it (per the AGENTS.md ask-to-remember rule), and promote only on a yes. There are no candidates.

### 1. Identify what was settled, and route it by type

For each settled item, pick the type by what it is. When ambiguous, default to **decision**.

- **decision** — a choice about what gets done, who does it, or a process or boundary. → write to `memory/decisions/decision-<slug>.md` per [DECISIONS-FORMAT.md](./DECISIONS-FORMAT.md).
- **preference** — how the user wants the assistant to behave or communicate. → merge into `memory/preferences/` (e.g. `assistant-style.md`).
- **voice** — a preference specific to voice-mode interaction. → merge into `memory/voice/voice-mode.md`.
- **workflow** — a repeated habit or sequence of steps. → merge into `memory/workflows/`.
- **doc** — an important reference, link, or path to remember. → merge into `memory/docs/important-docs.md`.
- **guide** — a reusable, redacted Halo ticket-resolution note. → merge into `memory/guides/<product>-<problem>.md`.
- **glossary entity** — a shorthand -> identity mapping (client short name, nickname, acronym, codename). → merge into `memory/glossary.md`. Contested/overloaded terms instead go to `CONTEXT.md` inline, per above.

For decisions, follow [DECISIONS-FORMAT.md](./DECISIONS-FORMAT.md). For preferences, voice, workflows, docs, and guides, follow [PROMOTED-MEMORY-FORMAT.md](./PROMOTED-MEMORY-FORMAT.md) — these merge into the owning topic file rather than creating one file per item. Both use the matching template in `memory/TEMPLATES.md` and write with `status: promoted`.

### 2. Before writing, check for existing entries

Scan `memory/index.md` and the relevant topic folder for a matching or superseded entry. If one exists, update it (bump `updated`, note what changed) rather than creating a duplicate.

### 3. Update the index and log

Update `memory/index.md` (Promoted Memory table) and append a `memory/log.md` entry, matching the formats in `memory/TEMPLATES.md`. If updating an existing entry, update its existing index row date/summary instead of adding a duplicate.

### 4. Tell the user

In one short line, say which items you recorded, their type, and where.

Skip an item only when it's purely transient (a one-off detail with no future relevance) or when it merely restates an existing recorded entry without changing it. If nothing qualifies, say so in one line.

Never store secrets, credentials, or sensitive client/third-party details in memory — summarize and redact per `memory/README.md`.
