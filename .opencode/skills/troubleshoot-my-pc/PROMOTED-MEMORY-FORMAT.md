# Promoted Memory Format (non-decision types)

This is the companion to [DECISIONS-FORMAT.md](./DECISIONS-FORMAT.md). It covers
the other types a `talk-it-through` session may settle and promote directly at
wrap-up: **preferences**, **workflows**, and **docs**.

Like decisions, these are **promoted memory** when settled in-session — the
user was actively in the loop, so the session itself is the approval and they
are promoted directly. Everything still follows the conventions in
`memory/README.md` and `memory/TEMPLATES.md`. Use this doc for routing and
shape; use `memory/TEMPLATES.md` for the canonical templates.

## Choosing the type

Pick by what the item *is*. When ambiguous, default to **decision** (see
DECISIONS-FORMAT.md).

- **preference** — how the user wants the assistant to behave or communicate.
  "Keep email replies to three sentences." "Don't use emojis."
- **workflow** — a repeated habit or sequence of steps the user follows.
  "Run the memory check before reporting a task complete."
- **doc** — an important reference, link, or path worth remembering, plus when
  to consult it. "The onboarding runbook lives at <path>; check it before
  provisioning a new user."

## Where it goes

These are **merge targets**, not one-file-per-item like decisions. Add to the
relevant section of the owning topic file rather than creating a new file per
item:

- **preference** → `memory/preferences/` (default `assistant-style.md`; or a
  more specific existing file, e.g. email tone lives in `memory/email/`).
- **workflow** → `memory/workflows/` (default a topical file such as
  `session-end.md`; create a new `memory/workflows/<slug>.md` only if no
  existing file fits).
- **doc** → `memory/docs/important-docs.md`.

Before writing, scan `memory/index.md` and the target folder for an existing
matching or superseded entry. If one exists, update it in place (bump
`updated`, note what changed) rather than duplicating.

## File shape

Follow the **Promoted Topic File** template in `memory/TEMPLATES.md`:

```md
---
title: Topic Title
type: preference | workflow | doc
status: promoted
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
topics: []
---

## Active memory

- Durable rule, habit, or reference. One line each.

## Notes

- Last reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
- Decided during a talk-it-through session on YYYY-MM-DD.
- Superseded rules, if any.
```

When merging into an existing topic file, add a bullet under `## Active memory`,
bump `updated`, and note the change under `## Notes` — do not rewrite unrelated
rules. For **docs**, the `## Active memory` bullet should capture both the
reference and *when to consult it*.

## What qualifies

Promote a non-decision item when it was clearly settled in-session and a future
session should rely on it without re-asking. Typically:

- **preference:** a stated communication or behavior rule the user confirmed.
- **workflow:** a repeated sequence or habit the user wants followed by default.
- **doc:** a reference the user pointed to as durably important.

## What to skip

- Purely transient, one-off details with no future relevance.
- Anything that just restates a promoted entry already recorded, unchanged.
- Anything merely **inferred but not explicitly confirmed** — do not write it.
  Ask the user (per the AGENTS.md ask-to-remember rule) and promote only if
  they confirm. There are no candidates.
- Secrets, credentials, or sensitive client/third-party specifics — summarize
  and redact per `memory/README.md`.

## After writing

1. Add or update the entry in its topic file.
2. Add or update the row in the Promoted Memory table in `memory/index.md`.
3. Append an entry to `memory/log.md` (Log template in `memory/TEMPLATES.md`).
4. Tell the user, in one line, which items were recorded, their type, and where.
