# Agents Library

All **232 agents** from The Agency, in Claude subagent format, organized by
division. Nothing here auto-loads — agents are invoked on demand, which keeps
the library effectively unlimited and avoids any subagent registration limits.

This is the single source of truth for agents in this workspace.
`.claude/agents/` is intentionally empty.

**Total: 232 agents across 16 divisions.**

Each `.md` file is a ready-to-use Claude subagent:

```yaml
---
name: <Agent Name>
description: <one-line specialty>
color: '#RRGGBB'
---
<body: identity, mission, workflows, deliverables, metrics>
```

## Picking agents (for skills / automation)

`index.json` is the catalog. Each entry:

```json
{
  "division": "engineering",
  "slug": "frontend-developer",
  "name": "Frontend Developer",
  "description": "Expert frontend developer specializing in ...",
  "color": "#3B82F6",
  "file": "agents-library/engineering/frontend-developer.md"
}
```

Filter by `division`, match on `name`/`description` keywords, then point at
`file`. A picker skill can read `index.json`, narrow candidates, and load the
chosen file's contents — no install or cap involved.

## How to invoke an agent

**On demand (recommended for this setup):** read the `.md` and adopt the
persona for the task. For example: *"Read `agents-library/engineering/sre.md`
and act as that agent."* This is what the picker skills will automate.

**Activate one to auto-load (optional):** copy a file into `.claude/agents/`.
Only do this for a small handful you want always-available:

```bash
cp agents-library/engineering/sre.md .claude/agents/
```

## Editing agents

These files **are** the source of truth — edit any `.md` directly. Each is plain
Claude subagent format (YAML frontmatter + Markdown body), no build step.

When you edit a file, keep the frontmatter fields in sync so `index.json` and the
file agree. If you change an agent's `name`/`description`/`color`, also update
the matching entry in `index.json` (same `slug`/`file`).

To **add** a new agent: drop a new `.md` into the right division folder (same
frontmatter shape), then add an entry to `index.json` with its `division`,
`slug` (filename without `.md`), `name`, `description`, `color`, and
`file` path.
